# Kosmos

A decentralized application for event management and ticketing.

## Demo Image

![Demo-Image](./demo-img.png)

## Functionality

1. Kosmos is a web3 platform similar to BookMyShow, where organizers use web2 logins to create events, while consumers use web3 wallets to buy tickets for these events.

2. All events are minted as NFTs and displayed on the platform's events page, allowing users to search for events using a search bar.

3. Organizers can create events by uploading cover images, specifying the number of seats available, and setting multiple dates and times for shows.

4. Consumers can review events for which they hold tickets in their web3 wallets.
